            <h2>Introduction to Mathematics</h2>
            <p>Mathematics is often referred to as the language of the universe. It is the study of patterns, structures, quantities, and relationships, using logical reasoning and precise language.</p>
            <p>Mathematics has been an integral part of human civilization for thousands of years, dating back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Greeks. Over time, mathematics has evolved and branched out into various fields, each with its own set of principles, concepts, and applications.</p>
            <p>One of the fundamental aspects of mathematics is its ability to describe and predict phenomena in the natural world. From the motion of celestial bodies to the behavior of subatomic particles, mathematics provides a framework for understanding the underlying principles governing our universe.</p>
            <p>Mathematics is also essential in many practical domains, including science, engineering, economics, and technology. It provides tools for analyzing data, solving problems, and making informed decisions.</p>
            <p>On this website, we aim to explore the diverse and fascinating world of mathematics, from basic arithmetic to advanced topics like calculus, algebra, and geometry. Whether you're a student looking to improve your math skills or a curious individual interested in learning more about the beauty and utility of mathematics, we hope you'll find valuable resources and insights here.</p>

            <p>Algebraic expressions, equations, and inequalities are fundamental concepts in algebra. An algebraic expression is a combination of numbers, variables, and operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. An equation is a mathematical statement asserting that two expressions are equal, while an inequality asserts that one expression is greater than or less than another.</p>
            <h3>Common Operations</h3>
            <p>In algebra, common operations include simplifying expressions, solving equations, factoring polynomials, and working with functions. These operations are essential for solving problems in algebra and for understanding more advanced mathematical concepts.</p>
